The term "NFT trading" is actually super competitive. Ahrefs puts it to the top end of the *hard* category.

The SERP looks accordingly: You only get high-authority websites, with one exception of a sub-niche specific one.

The results for this vague term are mixed up - there are both platforms and informational sources.

As far as search traffic goes, it seems that legacy businesses smelled the money and got in early. In other words, already established domain names are who dominate the search for NFT trading.

### Short comments to the SERP

The term NFT trading is pretty vague, and unless it is clear from your search history what you are looking for, Google has to give you both informational answers as well as the top platforms.

One interesting thing which may be an opportunity is that the SERP did not pick up [NFT games](https://www.altcointrading.net/best-nft-games-play2earn-list/) yet. It appears the big G only recognises NFT art by now.

### Some background comments on NFTs

NFTs are developing also as a sub-niche of DeFi, or decentralized finance. In finance, the use of non-fungible tokens is quite practical - for one-off things like contracts and such.

The future of DeFi looks pretty bright. Let's keep in mind what we have sketched out above: what makes defi what it is and what the possibilities are that lie ahead.

As far as what makes defi what it is, there's no reason why those three principles shouldn't stay the same - disintermediation, transparency and user-ownership should not disappear.   It wouldn't be defi then! The only thing that might change are the services offered by these platforms, with more to come down the line. While there are some markets where users can buy goods or services using cryptocurrencies directly (such as OpenBazaar), most of today's DEXes are dominated by peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies, not goods. Being able to buy stuff directly with crypto will certainly be a big step for the industry.

As far as what the future holds, the sky is the limit! Because DEFi platforms are entirely open source financial tools, they may be built upon. This opens up possibilities for what services consumers will be able to provide or access on their platform. What's best about it? They won't need an army of developers or billions of dollars to do that.
